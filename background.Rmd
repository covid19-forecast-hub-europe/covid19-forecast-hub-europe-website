The European Covid-19 Forecast Hub is run in collaboration between the [Epiforecasts team](http://epiforecasts.io/covid), which is part of the [Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infections Diseases](http://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19) at the [London School of Hygiene & Tropcial Medicine](http://www.lshtm.ac.uk), and the [European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention](http://ecdc.europa.eu).

It aims to collate and meaningfully combine short-term forecasts of Covid-19 from across Europe (EU and EFTA countries and the UK) in order to improve situational awareness and quantify the current trajectory of Covid-19 everywhere whilst acknowledging uncertainty. This approach was pioneered by the [Reich lab](https://reichlab.io/) and follows similar projects in the [USA](https://covid19forecasthub.org/) and in [Germany and Poland](https://kitmetricslab.github.io/forecasthub/forecast). Another related project is the [US scenario hub](https://covid19scenariomodelinghub.org/).

For more information on technical details and contributors, visit the [project pages on github](https://github.com/epiforecasts/covid19-forecast-hub-europe). from anywhere in the world are invited to submit forecasts once a week for one or more of the countries. Take a look at the [submission instructions](https://github.com/epiforecasts/covid19-forecast-hub-europe/wiki) and [get in touch](contact.html) with any questions.

# Limitations

The European Covid-19 Forecast Hub aims at providing forecasts in real time and evaluating systematically how reliable these forecasts are. Please keep the following in mind when interpreting forecasts:

- Real-time forecasts of epidemics, and particularly of Covid-19, have proven challenging in the past. Case forecasts in particular can be difficult in the face of changing testing practices, delays and capacities. Deaths are a more lagged measure and thus can be easier to predict.
- Reported data and short-term trends can be subject to uncertainty in particular around holiday periods, when testing behaviour can be very difficult to predict across countries. Models may not reflect how this affects observed data and could misintepret a transient aberration in the data as a genuine trend.
- Model outputs are collected up to four weeks into the future and generally decrease in accuracy over this time period. Confirmed cases up to 1 to 2 weeks ahead and deaths up to 3 weeks ahead are assumed to be largely unaffected by future changes in control measures. Forecasts beyond these time horizons are subject to increased uncertainty as future interventions may affect outcomes.
